<img src="README.png" width="300" height="180" alt="Social network icons">


## Abstract

We believe social networks have significant benefits for people and society. However, the big social networks suffer from major problems: data breaches, fake accounts, poor accountability, rife advertising, and restricted rights; these problems harm people and society. 

We want to explore the viability of new social network that aims for more social good. This document is a request for comments and ideas about funding, audiences, scopes, niches, security, and more.

Original content vs. resharing

* "Reshares are part and parcel of a community - even before the days of the Internet. For many, gossip is part of socializing. A friend posted that he's just getting married. People will want to spread the word. How can they without reshares? Rewrite it themselves? Resharing is simply part of usual human interaction."

<!-- How to describe a social network?

We see challenges in how people describe social networks; we suggest starter questions.

Examples:

* **Benefits**: give me reasons to try your product.
* **Privacy**: what is your privacy policy, including sharing with 3rd party?
* **Platform**: is your product aiming to be a platform, API, plugin, integation, etc.?
* **Access**: mobile, web, desktop, native, etc.?
* **Code**: open source, closed source, etc.?
* (more?)
