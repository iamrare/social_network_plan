# Feeds: linear, algorithmic, customizable? #11

[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/11)

Discuss feeds and how to decide what the feeds show in terms of stories, posts, photos, etc., such as a linear feed that shows everything, or an algorithmic feed that automatically guesses what the user may want to see, or a customizable feed that lets the user choose options for what shows up.


### Quotations

Quotations to consider:

* "I wish there was a social network that could somehow avoid people competing to post the highest volume of popular content, so they could relax and focus on posting information about themselves that other people want to know. But even if you were somehow able to force people to just post about themselves, no third-party content, there are plenty of people who would make a meal of it by posting endless videos about their grooming regimen, their cooking, or cute stuff their cat does. It all just devolves into competing for attention."
