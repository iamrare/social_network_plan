### Quotations

Quotations to consider:

* "The incentives created by an advertising business model are to essentially addict people psychologically to your product, and then to cause outrage cycles. You want to feed them stuff that either makes them afraid or angry, because when they’re excited by low level emotions like that, they share more stuff, they’re more active, they spend more time on the site, and see more ads, and they’re just more valuable to them."

* "We cannot afford the advertising business model. The price of free is actually too high. It is literally destroying our society, because it incentivizes automated systems that have these inherent flaws."

* "Subscription sounds like it might be a good idea because it seems like it would remove the incentive to monetize personal information, but in practice it creates a barrier to adoption and makes the social network kind of useless."

### Comments

"Lobby government to provide $X annually per citizen that gets allocated to the user's choice to pay for their social network platform of choice; this would have to be tied to specific rules/guidelines. E.g. mandatory tax money that the person distributes how they want. Whether this will lead to the desired outcome, I'm unsure - people might still just want to give their money to Facebook or a platform who takes that money + still does less-than-good or less-than-desired behaviours, requiring regulation and oversight, costing taxpayers anyway. It might also incentivize private dollars to be more willing to invest in platforms if there's that money per-user that would be available."

"Create enough value that people - or enough people - are willing to pay; this ties into freemium model or subscription model."

"Investment should come from a combination of sources: - From government -- if you can't convince a government to invest, then why not? - From philanthropic -- who will have a longer horizon than traditional VC, and who will hopefully require a higher burden on evidence that the leader(s) are good people. - From traditional VC -- who can benefit by reducing risk from the other funding sources, and to leverage the experienced VC's network and resources."
