[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/22)


### Coordinated disclosure

Coordinated disclosure, sometimes a.k.a. responsible disclosure, explains how people can report potential security issues, and work together to address the issues.

### Dropbox

Dropbox is publishing a security disclosure policy, and also blogging about it.

Excerpts:

* 1. A clear statement that external security research is welcomed.

* 2. A pledge to not initiate legal action for security research conducted pursuant to the policy, including good faith, accidental violations.

* 3. A clear statement that we consider actions consistent with the policy as constituting “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).

* 4. A pledge that we won’t bring a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) action against a researcher for research consistent with the policy.

* 5. A pledge that if a third party initiates legal action, Dropbox will make it clear when a researcher was acting in compliance with the policy (and therefore authorized by us).
