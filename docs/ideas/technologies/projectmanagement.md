# Project management

[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/17)

Discuss project priorities such as:

* This project is more akin to an ambitious web app, less akin to a blogging site.
* We value participation by many people and organizations.
* The security needs to be bulletproof and independently-verifiable.

Discuss project expectations such as:

* Prefer truly free technology over corporate-restricted technology.
* Prefer more-welcoming communities over less-welcoming communities.
* Prefer agile over waterfall.
* Prefer continuous delivery rather than using sprints.
* Prefer faster releases of small items over slower releases of big items.
* Prefer to use delivery throttles over all-or-none releases.

Discuss project tools such as:

* Planning e.g. Asana, Trello
* Dicussion e.g. IRC, Slack
* Prototyping e.g. Balsamiq, Photoshop

Discuss project methodologies such as:

* Agile, lean, kanban, waterfall, etc.
* Model, view, controller (MVC), data, context, interaction (DCI), etc.
* Functional code may be easier to create reliably and easier to scale up.
