# Routes: how to reach people, places, items, resources?


## Route

We use the term "route" to generically describe a way to reach people, places, items, resources, etc.

Examples:

* Email addresses: <a href="mailto:alice@example.com">alice@example.com</a>
* Phone number: <a href="tel:1-415-317-2700">1-415-317-2700</a>
* Web page: <a href="http://reddit.com">http://reddit.com</a>


## Meta-route

We use the term "meta-route" to generically describe a route that contains another route.

Examples where each website URL route contains another route:

* Email address: <a href="https://www.example.com/alice@example.com">https://www.example.com/alice@example.com</a>
* Phone number: <a href="https://www.example.com/1-415-317-2700">https://www.example.com/1-415-317-2700</a>
* Web page: <a href="https://example.com/reddit.com">https://example.com/reddit.com</a>


## Brainstorms

Brainstorms about routes and meta-routes:

* We speculate that meta-routes may make it easier, faster, and better, to create a user-friendly social network that also connects to other networks.

* For example meta-routes can automatically give each person their own page based on their email address, or on their multiple email addresses; the person doesn't have to choose a new username or compete with other people for usernames.

* For example, meta-routes may improve people's trust in the network, because the URL contains more information that can be automatically verified, such as verifying the person's email address by sending an email, or telephone number by sending a text message, or website page by having a webmaster add a page identifier.
