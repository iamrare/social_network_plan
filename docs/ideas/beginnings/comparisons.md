# Comparisons: similarities & differences versus others?

[Issue discussion](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/social_network_plan/issues/4)

Discuss comparisons, similarities, and differences versus other social networks and other social network plans.


### Quotations

Quotations to consider:

* "The social startups that have struck it big in the post-Facebook era have all started by carving out a different niche. That difference can’t just be about a site’s back-end architecture or business model, as with Diaspora (an open-source Facebook) or App.net (a Twitter without ads). The product itself has to fulfill a fresh purpose for its users, like sharing snazzy smartphone snapshots (Instagram), networking and advancing their careers (LinkedIn), or showing off their taste in fashion, food, and design (Pinterest)."

* "The problem with Facebook is that it holds way too much personal information about a person - phone numbers, emails, a person's likes/dislikes, hometown, current location, etc, and because society has been 'programmed' to share so much about themselves, no thanks to social networks like Facebook that promotes building your 'profile'. In fact, strip away all that personal information and have people share their thoughts and their dinner photos and what you get is just Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat or a blogging platform."

### Example ideas

Example ideas from real people to consider:

Similarities to many existing social networks:
* I want a profile photo, like on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.
* I want to post an item, such as a status update, or photo, or link.

Differences from many existing social networks:
* I want to use a pseudeonym, not my real name.
* I want a personal page and a professional page.
* I want ways to do more locally, e.g. like NextDoor.
* I want to promote my small business to neighbors.

Versus Twitter:
* I want a longer username, not limited to 15-characters.
* I want long posts.

Versus Facebook:
* I want separation e.g. peers vs. news, work vs. home, family vs. friends.
* I want a pin area so I can feature my current interests e.g. links to music.
* I want to share with groups of people e.g. circles.
* I want more ways to shape my feed, e.g. more photos of friends, fewer photos of food.
* I want fewer ads and/or more-relevant ads.

Versus LinkedIn:
* I want to be able to apply for jobs more easily.
* I want to feature my skills, rather than feature my resume or CV.
* I want to follow company news, yet not get overwhelmed.
* I want to automatically connect to all my coworkers e.g. enterprise address book.
