Original content vs. resharing

* "Reshares are part and parcel of a community - even before the days of the Internet. For many, gossip is part of socializing. A friend posted that he's just getting married. People will want to spread the word. How can they without reshares? Rewrite it themselves? Resharing is simply part of usual human interaction."

<!-- How to describe a social network?

We see challenges in how people describe social networks; we suggest starter questions.

Examples:

* **Benefits**: give me reasons to try your product.
* **Privacy**: what is your privacy policy, including sharing with 3rd party?
* **Platform**: is your product aiming to be a platform, API, plugin, integation, etc.?
* **Access**: mobile, web, desktop, native, etc.?
* **Code**: open source, closed source, etc.?
* (more?)
